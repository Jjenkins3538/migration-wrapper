## About the package

This package was built entirely within Laravel. 
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

This package requires minimum Laravel 10.x in order to use prompts (command line forms -- the main inspiration behind this package)

You will also need composer installed with PHP 8+, a good understanding of string manipulation/validation, and a basic understanding of Illuminate\Filesystem

The purpose of this package is to allow the creation of migration files from within the CLI, without the need to edit the file yourself (you can if you choose, of course)

The meat of the logic can be found within App\Commands\MigrationCreator.php

## Additional Info
This project is still under active development, and is not worth using for anything other than a local sandbox or learning prompts
